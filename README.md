# Project Proposal: AI Study Assistant

## What
AI Study Assistant is an innovative web-based tool designed to assist students in effectively managing and enhancing their academic experience. This application leverages artificial intelligence to provide personalized learning support, from class preparation to assignment completion and exam preparation.

## Why
Students often struggle with managing various aspects of their academic life, including keeping track of assignments, understanding complex topics, and effectively preparing for exams. The AI Study Assistant aims to alleviate these challenges by offering an intelligent, personalized learning companion. By simplifying and streamlining the study process, it aims to improve academic performance, reduce stress, and make learning more engaging and efficient.

## How
The AI Study Assistant will integrate AI algorithms for various functionalities:

- **Class Notes/Documents Analysis**: AI will process uploaded syllabus and class notes to extract key points and create study materials.
- **Discussion and Question Tracking**: Key discussion points and professor's questions from classes can be input for AI analysis and study focus suggestions.
- **Assignment and Reading Management**: The tool will help in managing and prioritizing assignments and readings.
- **Reminders and Notifications**: Automatic reminders for due dates, tests, and preparation schedules.
- **Class Preparation and Review Tools**: Features for class previews, in-class assistance, and post-class reviews.
- **Study and Test Preparation**: Personalized study sessions and test preparation tools based on the student's progress.
- **Brainstorming for Assignments**: Assistance in brainstorming and planning for assignments.

## For Whom
This tool is primarily aimed at college students who seek a more organized and effective way to manage their academic tasks. It's particularly beneficial for those who struggle with keeping track of multiple courses, find it challenging to synthesize class materials, or those who could benefit from a structured study and revision schedule.

## Scope
The initial phase of the project will focus on developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that includes:

- **Basic Class Notes Integration and Analysis**: To extract and summarize key points.
- **Due Date and Test Reminders**: Implementation of a simple reminder system for upcoming academic deadlines.
- **Class Preview Feature**: Providing an overview of upcoming class topics.
- **Post-Class Recap and Review**: Summarizing key points covered in class.
